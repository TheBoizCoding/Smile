```diff
+ Unity 2019.4.34f1 because most have some experience with it, this version specific because its LTS and working nice on Linux to
+ Git as SourceControll advanced with Github
- Unity Colaborate isn't that nice, Tryed it out a lot, also Git is a pretty usefull skill 
+ 3D because Erik is Good at 3D Modeling
+ New inputSystem because it's just better
+ URP because making better stuff with HDRP needs much more Knowledge and Skill and URP is also really Great
+ PostProcessing Package because a little bit of Gloom lets everything look better
+ ShaderGraph becuse writing shaders diretly in glsl is a lot of work
+ Cinemachine for the Camera because writing your mostly isnt as good and efficent
+ ProBuilder for Making the Maps because its a Good Tool
+ a StateMachine is Needed for the Game, we need to build it by our own
- you could use the Animator, but It doesn't really fit for a great StateMachine
